-------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 1: Create a GitHub Account (Free)

i. Go to GitHub
Open your browser and go to:
👉 https://github.com

ii. Sign Up
Click the green "Sign up" button.

iii. Fill in Your Details

- Username: e.g., yourname484
- Email: your real email (e.g., you@gmail.com)
- Password: a strong one (e.g., MyPass123!)
- Click "Continue"

iv. Verify You’re Not a Robot
Complete the puzzle or checkbox (like "I’m not a robot").

v. Confirm Your Email

- GitHub will send a confirmation email
- Open your email → click the "Verify email" link

✅ Done! You now have a GitHub account.

------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 2: Create a New Repository (Your First Project Folder)

A repository (repo) is like a folder for your code.

i. On GitHub, Click the "+" Icon
Top-right corner → Click "+" → Choose "New repository"

ii. Fill in Repository Details

- Repository name: my-first-project (or any name)
- Description (optional): "My first code project"
- Public (free and visible to all) ✅
- Don’t initialize with README (we’ll do it in VS Code) ❌

Click "Create repository"
✅ Your repo is created!

iii. Create a New Branch (Optional but Recommended)
By default, you're on the main branch.

To create a new branch:

a. Click the branch dropdown (says "main")
Top-left of the file list → click "main"

b. Type a new branch name
e.g., dev or feature-login

c. Click "Create branch: dev"
✅ Now you’re on a new branch called dev

💡 You can switch between branches anytime. 

-------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 3: Install & Connect VS Code with GitHub

i. Download and Install VS Code
Go to:
👉 https://code.visualstudio.com

Click "Download" → Run the installer → Install

✅ Open VS Code after installing.

ii. Install the Git Extension (Usually Already Installed)

- VS Code comes with Git support built-in
- No extra install needed

iii. Sign in to GitHub in VS Code

a. Open VS Code
Click the Accounts icon (bottom-left corner) → it looks like a circle

b. Click "Sign in to GitHub..."
A browser window will open.

c. Log in to your GitHub account
Click "Authorize Visual Studio Code"

✅ You’re now signed in!

-------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 4: Clone (Download) Your GitHub Repo to VS Code
Now get your repo from GitHub to your computer.

i. Go to Your GitHub Repo

Open in browser:
https://github.com/your-username/my-first-project

ii. Click the Green "Code" Button
 - Click "Code"
 - Click the copy icon (📋) next to https://github.com/...
This copies the repo link

iii. Open VS Code and Clone

a. Open Command Palette
In VS Code: Press Ctrl + Shift + P (or Cmd + Shift + P on Mac)

Type: Git: Clone → Select it

b. Paste the Repository URL
Paste the link you copied (e.g., https://github.com/yourname/my-first-project.git)

Press Enter

c. Choose a Folder on Your Computer
Pick where to save it (e.g., Desktop or Documents)

Click "Select Repository Location"

✅ VS Code downloads your repo!

iv. Open the Project

- After cloning, VS Code will ask: "Would you like to open the folder?"
- Click "Open"

Now you can:

✅ See your repo in the left panel
✅ Create or edit files
✅ Save and push changes

-------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 5: Pull Latest Code (If Updated on GitHub)
If you (or someone) made changes on GitHub, pull them:

In VS Code:

i. Click the Source Control icon (left sidebar, looks like 2 arrows 🔄)
ii. Click the "..." (More Actions) → Choose "Pull"

✅ Your code is now up to date!

💡 Shortcut: Ctrl + Shift + P → type Git: Pull 
--------------------------------------------------------
🟢  Verification Process:
--------------------------------------------------------
After pulling the code, it's a good idea to perform a few verification steps to make sure:

- Your setup is working correctly
- You can edit and push changes back to GitHub
- VS Code is fully connected to your GitHub repository

Here are the recommended verification steps:

--------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 6: Confirm the Files Are Correct

i. In VS Code, open the Explorer (file icon on the left sidebar).
ii. Check if your files (e.g., hello.py, README.md) are visible.
iii. Click on a file to open it and verify the code matches what’s on GitHub.
✅ This ensures the correct code was pulled.

--------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 7: Make a Small Change (Test Edit)

i. Open any file (e.g., hello.py or README.md).
ii. Add a small change: 
print("This is a test from VS Code!")

iii. Save the file: Press Ctrl + S (or Cmd + S on Mac).
✅ This confirms you can edit files locally.

--------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 8: Commit and Push the Change

i. Click the Source Control icon (🔄) on the left.
ii. You’ll see your changed file under "Changes".
iii. Click the + (Stage Changes) button.
iv. In the message box, type a commit message:

test: My first edit from VS Code

v. Click the ✓ (Commit) button.
vi. Click the ↑ (Push) button (or go to Ctrl + Shift + P → Git: Push).
✅ If no error appears, your change is sent to GitHub!

--------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 9: Verify on GitHub Website

i. Open your browser and go to:

https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name

ii. Check:
- Did your commit message appear?
- Is your new code visible in the file?

✅ This confirms: VS Code ↔ GitHub connection is working perfectly!

--------------------------------------------------------

🟢 Step 10: Optional – Pull Again (Reverse Test)
If you (or someone else) make a change directly on GitHub:

i. Go back to VS Code.
ii. Click ... → Pull in the Source Control panel.
iii. Confirm the change appears in your local files.

✅ This proves you can stay in sync with the team.

(These steps are very helpful for very beginners & by these step beginners can understand the Code work process with Github, thank you)
